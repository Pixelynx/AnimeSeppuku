# AnimuSeppuku
---
## MVP
Animu Seppuku is a little web application that has a relatively identical concept as hangman. The only different is that instead of a man's body parts gradually being build for every incorrect guess until you have a full body that has been hanged; once you've run out of guesses, an anime character will commit seppuku as you have brought dishonour upon them. This web application will be built using JavaScript integrating the Canvas API. The initial renidition of this application will be able to accomplish the following:

* Display an empty stage except a lonesome katana and a number of blank spaces for a random word/phrase to be guessed
* The ability to guess one letter at a time
* The ability to guess the entire word/phrase
* A countdown of chances the player has left
* A winning/losing screen
* The ability to play again
